This GaborIBL Task has been modified. 
Visual stimulation signal measured from photodiode does not follow the position of the wheel, as it is in original task. 
Instead the screen changes its luminance level only at the onset and offset of the visual stimulus. this results that detection of visual stimulation onset is more reliable and straightforward
