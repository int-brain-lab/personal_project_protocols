# ksocha_midbrain_project
ksocha_optoProtocols - protocols compatible with IBL rigs used for optogenetics manipulations:
- during the IBL biased-blocks task: ephys rig (_iblrig_tasks_ksocha_ephysOptoChoiceWorld), behavior rig (_iblrig_tasks_ksocha_opto_biasedChoiceWorld)
- passive laser stimulation (with no visual stimulus, no reward, no sound): ephys rig (_iblrig_tasks_ksocha_ephysOptoStimulation), behavior_rig (_iblrig_ksocha_OptoStimulation)
- passive visual stimulation, same as passiveChoiceWorld (_iblrig_tasks_ksocha_ephysPassiveStimulation); it displays visual stimulation, and task-events outside of the task, in following order: spontanous activity (blank screen, no stimulation, 10min); RF Mapping (sparse noise, 5min); task-events-reply (visuals stimulus from the task, goCue sound, error noise, reward valve cliks, 40 trials, 5min)

Protocols (passiveChoiceWorld, ephysChoiceWorld, biasedChoiceWorld) were originally written by NiccoloÌ€ Bonacchi for the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) project, and later modified by Karolina Socha (see description below _iblrig_tasks_ksocha_ephysOptoChoiceWorld).
The task structure (80/20 biased-blocks version) remained as described in the International Brain Laboratory et al. (eLife) 2021 https://elifesciences.org/articles/63711.

Modifications in protocol _iblrig_tasks_ksocha_ephysOptoChoiceWorld included:
1. removing first 90 trials with 50% probability (as it is in the original IBL task for ephys recordings)
2. adding laser stimulation at different task events - LASER_STIMULATION_WHERE= ['iti', 'quiescence', 'go_cue','stimulus_on']: 
- inter-trial-interval (ITI) - laser_out_iti; 
- quiescence period - laser_out_quiescence
- visual stimulus onset - laser_out_stimulus
- goCue onset - laser_out_go_cue
3. adding prestimulus time for trials with stimulation during quiescence; eg. 300ms before visual stimulus PRESTIMULUS_TIME_LASER=0.3 - PRESTIMULUS_TIME_LASER
4. adding general laser probability - LASER_PROBABILITY
5. adding probability of laser stimulation at different task events - PROBABILITY_LASER_STIMULATION_WHERE
6. adding condition that laser stimulation occurs only for specific contrasts values during the task: 100%, 12.5%, 0%.
CONTRAST_LASER_SET = [1.0, 0.125, 0.0] (can be removed or added contrasts that originally apeared in the IBL protocol; 100%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 0%)
8. removing "poop count"
POOP_COUNT = False  # Wether to ask for a poop count at the end of the session

These values can be modified in task_settings file (lines 60-68), example:

- LASER_PROBABILITY=0.3 # PROBABILITY OF LASER (this is overall probability of laser stimulation)
- PRESTIMULUS_TIME_LASER=0.3 # time in s before visual stimulus for quiecence laser trials
- CONTRAST_LASER_SET = [1.0, 0.125, 0.0] # Laser stimulation contrast set
- LASER_STIMULATION_WHERE=['iti', 'quiescence', 'go_cue','stimulus_on']
- PROBABILITY_LASER_STIMULATION_WHERE = [0,0,0,1] # 30% of laser trials corresponds to stimulation at visual stimulus onset; sum of these values = 1 ; if [0,.5,0,.5] this means that these 30% of laser trials will be splitted equally (50%) between quiescence or stimulus_on events;

Additionally you can add information about laser stimulation type, example:
- LASER_WAVEFORM='square'
- LASER_POWER='0.25' # in mW
